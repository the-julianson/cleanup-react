# 🧠 React `useEffect` Cleanup Demo — Quote Race Condition

This is a React demo that visually shows the importance of using a cleanup function to avoid **race conditions** when working with async logic inside `useEffect`.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

A “Next Quote” button fetches a quote (with **random network delay**) and updates the UI.

If you click the button rapidly, you’ll trigger multiple fetches for different quote IDs.

This helps you observe:

- How stale responses can override newer ones (when cleanup is **off**)
- How a simple flag + cleanup avoids this entirely (when cleanup is **on**)

---

## 🚦 How to Use

1. Start the app
2. In the UI, click “➡ Next Quote” a few times
3. Keep your browser **console open**

---

## ✅ With Cleanup ON

- Only the **latest** quote is shown after loading
- Console shows:

```bash
✅ Fetched quote #4 and setting it 
❌ Cleanup: Skipping stale quote #3 
❌ Cleanup: Skipping stale quote #2
```

- ✨ UI stays consistent — no flickering, no stale data

## ❌ With Cleanup OFF

- Click the “Cleanup is ON/OFF” button to toggle **cleanup OFF**
- Rapidly click “➡ Next Quote” several times
- Watch the console and the UI

You’ll notice:

- Flickering in the UI (you briefly see old quotes)
- Console shows **multiple** logs like:

```bash
✅ Fetched quote #X and setting it
```
…for quotes that should've been ignored!

## 🧪 Why This Matters

Disabling a button on `loading` might help in small demos — but in real-world apps:

- Async effects can come from **routing**, **sockets**, **props**, or **form changes**
- You can’t always rely on buttons to protect your UI

**The cleanup function is your safeguard against race conditions.**

If you're learning React, this is a great exercise to internalize `useEffect` behavior.
